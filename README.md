# Chat with Git

Chat with Git is a prototype application written to demonstrate the power of embeddings and vector databases.
You need to clone a git repository locally and hard code its path in the app.py script.

<font color="red">**WARNING**</font>: Don't try this on large git repositories, as the openai-embeddings is slow and will cost you a lot of money.

The folowing python libraries are used
- OpenAI (For creating embeddings)
- ChromaDB (VectorDB for storing the embeddings)
- Langchain (Python framework for developing apps powered by LLM)
- Streamlit (Frontend UI for the chatbot)
